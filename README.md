# ♻️ Garbage Classification using Transfer Learning
**AICTE – Edunet Internship Project (2025)**

Welcome to the official repository of my **Garbage Image Classification** project, designed as part of the AICTE x Edunet internship. This project utilizes **deep learning with transfer learning (EfficientNetV2B2)** to accurately classify images of garbage into 6 different waste types.

🚀 **Enhanced with better model handling, clean code, and optimized for Git + LFS support.**
